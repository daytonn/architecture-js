##About

ArchitectureJS is a suite of tools to help you build and manage complex javascript applications and frameworks. With ArchitectureJS you can create project scaffolding, manage third-party packages, compile, and compress your javascript application, all in real time as you write plain old vanilla javascript. In addition to large applications, ArchitectureJS is perfect for developing your own javascript frameworks and libraries. ArchitectureJS contains the following components which help you build modern javascript applications and frameworks:

* JavaScript Compiler (Sprockets 1.0.2)
* JavaScript Compressor (JSMin)
* Scaffold generation using editable templates
* Custom local JavaScript package management
* Realtime file monitoring utility to compile your application while you code
* Project-specific configuration to manage defaults and dependencies
 
##Contributing to architecture.js
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
